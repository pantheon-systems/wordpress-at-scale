# Can WordPress Scale?

## Yes. Â It's a proven fact.

With the right infrastructure and development practices in place, WordPress can push hundreds of millions, even billions of pageviews a month. It can serve tens of thousands of logged-in users. And it can be lightning-fast the whole time. The question is not whether WordPress itself can scale, but whether or not your implementation is ready.

These documents are intended to communicate true best practices from teams that have deep real-world experience in running WordPress at scale. The intention is to provide a useful starting place for scalable implementations, for both development teams as well as business owners.

### Prepare for Liftoff

In order for your WordPress website to scale and meet the demands of your growing business, it needs to:

*   Be horizontally scalable by hosting on an elastic architecture 
*   Use full page caching independent of WordPress itself 
*   Employ a high performance persistent object cache 
*   Follow best practices for querying data 
*   Set up with solid development, testing, and deployment workflows 

Confident your WordPress implementation has all these things? Congrats!
